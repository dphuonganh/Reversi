## The process

Together, read carefully the subject for the project and, before starting to code anything, create a file called team_agreement.md. Define the rules together, and write them in the file. You are free to format the file in whatever way you want.


## What goes in the team agreement?

The team agreement should address the following points:

* the name of the team (it's up to you, you can be creative or to the point!)
* the working hours each member commits to
* how often you will check-in with the code of others (= how often you update each other on your progress)
* the strengths and weaknesses of each member
* the allocation of the workload between members
* your strategy so that everybody understands the codebase

## A final word

**EVERYBODY must understand the codebase**. If a group member cannot explain something they didn't code, you failed as a group. This is about group learning, if your teammate doesn't understand your code, walk them carefully through it.
